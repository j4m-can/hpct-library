    Usage
    -----
    This relation interface describes the expected behavior of any charm
    claiming to be able to provide or consume ingress per unit data.

    In most cases, this will be accomplished using the ingress library,
    although charm developers are free to provide alternative libraries
    as long as they fulfill the behavioral and schematic requirements
    described in this document.

    Direction
    ---------
    The ingress-per-unit interface implements a provider/requirer
    pattern. The consumer is a charm that wishes to receive ingress per
    unit, and the provider is a charm able to provide it.

    Behavior
    --------
    * Is expected to provide ingress for the remote applications
        requesting it.
    * Is expected to respect the ingress parameters sent by the
        requirer: hostname, port and model name (namespace).
    * Is expected to publish the ingress url via relation data. The
        url is expected to have the following structure:
            http://[ingress hostname]:[ingress port]/[app-name]-[model-name]/

        where:
        * ingress hostname and url are the hostname and urls that the
            ingress is configured with
        * app-name is the name of the application requesting ingress
        * model-name is the name of the model the application
            requesting ingress is deployed into

        The structure of this URL is fixed in the generic ingress
        schema; specific ingress providers implementations may offer
        some way of customising it.
